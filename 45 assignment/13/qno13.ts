// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

const transport:string[]=["land crusior","bugati","supra",];
console.log(`${transport[0]},"you are my love"`);
console.log(`${transport[0]},"i will buy you after selling land crusiur"`);
console.log(`${transport[0]},"you are my last option"`);
